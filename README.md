- Make payments between user accounts

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mobile-payment-system.git
   
   
   
Navigate to the project directory:
cd mobile-payment-system

Run the main.py file to start the mobile payment system:
python main.py

Follow the on-screen prompts to check balances or make payments.

Disclaimer
This is a simplified example for educational purposes and should not be used for real-world financial transactions. In a production environment, you would need to implement robust security measures, user authentication, and integrate with secure payment gateways.
